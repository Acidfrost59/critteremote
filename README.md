WoW Addon BP Critter Emote

This addon will have your summoned non-combat pet do fun and random things. The terms 'critter' and 'pet' refer to non-combat pets in this file.

When you have a pet out every so often it will emote something fun. You can have your pets become more interactive by having them emote custom actions by using /ce instead of /emote.

Your pets will now respond to in-game emotes.  Target your summoned pet and try /wave or /angry.

Your pet will do an emote every five to ten minutes as long as you are not in combat or a pet battle.
Pets are fun things, if you target something else, they just might do or say something to the target.

If you find any typos, or mistakes please let me know and I'll fix them.

If you would like to add your own emotes edit the file CritterEmote_Emotes.lua You can also delete emotes you just don't like. It is important to note that when you do make changes to the .lua that new updates from Twitch will erase them. You may want to save them to a text file or, better yet, send them to me and I'll review them to add to or consider their removal from the main release :)

Usage:
/ce - have your non-combat pet perform a random emote.
/ce <message> - have your critter emote your <message>.
/ce [options] - perform the various option:
[options] =
info     : displays Critter Emote information.
help     : displays this help.
off      : turns the random emote off.
on       : turns the random emotes back on
options  : Displays current options
silly    : Toggles silly emotes
jokes    : Toggles joke emotes
locations: Toggles location emotes
songs    : Toggles song emotes
faction  : Toggles faction emotes
        
Currently emotes can be in the following category:

Default - for all Battle Pets, Companion Pets, Vanity Pets (critters)
type - subtype of critter ( cat )
name - specific critter ( Lil' K.T. )

Under each category there is 
emote - such as /cry or /wave
random - anything
target - if something is targeted
